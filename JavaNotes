Variable
============
Variable is name of storage location where we can store data

Java support 3 types of variable
1.Local
2.Instance
3.Static

Local variable
===================
Variable declared inside method/block that variable is local

Scope: Within method
Memory allocated:At the time of method execution memory allocated
Memory deallocated:After execution of method

Instance Variable
======================
Variable declare inside the class and outside any block any method is called instance variable

scope: Within Object
Memory allocation: At the time Object creation memory allocated
Memory deallocate: After object destroyed

Note:
----------
Instance variable get the new memory for every new object


static keyword
=============
In Java static keyword plays important role
as static method/variable we use for memory management

Static variable/class level variable
=========================
Variable declare inside the class and outside any block any method and declare
with static keyword is called static variable

scope: within a class
Memory allocation: As soon as class loaded memory allocated
Memory deallocate: After class unload

Note:
-------------
static variable get the memory only once and same memory share with other objects
To call static data we dont need any Object

======================================
Data Structure
=============
Data structure is way to represent our data so that we can 
manage and perform certain operations on that data

Array/Arrays
===============
Arrays is predefined class in java 

Array is static data structure
Array is collection of similar type of data/Objects
Array size is always fix size
Array implemented in java as Object

Types
==========
1.Single dimension array(1D)
2.Multi dimension array(2D)

Ways to declare array
========================
1. Using new keyword
2. Using literal

Syntax
=============
datatype arrayvariable_name[]=new datatype[size];

Iterate array
=============
1.Simple for loop
2.for each loop
==============================

	this Keyword, super keyword & final keyword
	we can use in inheritance

this keyword is used to refer current class variable,method and constructor.

Super Keyword
============================
1.Super keyword can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
2.Super keyword can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
3.Super keyword can be used to call immediate parent class constructor.(super())

final Keyword
======================================
final keyword can be apply for variable,method and class
1.If we apply final keyword to variable then that variable will be consider constant variable
(value will become fix...no one can update)
2.If we apply final keyword to method then we cant override that method in other class or child class
3.If we apply final keyword to class then we can not extend that class into another class.
===============================================================
IQ: How we can implement immutable class ,variable or method in java?
Ans: Using final keyword.
==============================================================







Data Abstraction
================
It is process of hiding implementation details of software from end user and providing
 relevant information to the user.

Abstraction acheive using
------------------------------
1.Abstract class
2.Interface

1.Abstract class
===============
1.In abstract class we can have both abstract method and non abstract (concreate) Methods.
2.Abstract method and class we can declare using abstract keyword.
3.Abstract class can not be instantiated.
4.Abstract methods must be overriden by class which inherits abstract class.
5.Using Abstract class partial abstraction is possible.

Interface
===========
1.An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. 
2.Interface contains final and static variables.
3.Interface contains abstract methods.
4.An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body.
5.Methods in interface are public by default.
6.Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
7.We can define interface with interface keyword.
8.A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface
 but a class implements an interface.
9.We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.
10.Inheritance use extends keyword and Interface use implements keyword.
