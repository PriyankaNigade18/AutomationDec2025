Variable
============
Variable is name of storage location where we can store data

Java support 3 types of variable
1.Local
2.Instance
3.Static

Local variable
===================
Variable declared inside method/block that variable is local

Scope: Within method
Memory allocated:At the time of method execution memory allocated
Memory deallocated:After execution of method

Instance Variable
======================
Variable declare inside the class and outside any block any method is called instance variable

scope: Within Object
Memory allocation: At the time Object creation memory allocated
Memory deallocate: After object destroyed

Note:
----------
Instance variable get the new memory for every new object


static keyword
=============
In Java static keyword plays important role
as static method/variable we use for memory management

Static variable/class level variable
=========================
Variable declare inside the class and outside any block any method and declare
with static keyword is called static variable

scope: within a class
Memory allocation: As soon as class loaded memory allocated
Memory deallocate: After class unload

Note:
-------------
static variable get the memory only once and same memory share with other objects
To call static data we dont need any Object

======================================
Data Structure
=============
Data structure is way to represent our data so that we can 
manage and perform certain operations on that data

Array/Arrays
===============
Arrays is predefined class in java 

Array is static data structure
Array is collection of similar type of data/Objects
Array size is always fix size
Array implemented in java as Object

Types
==========
1.Single dimension array(1D)
2.Multi dimension array(2D)

Ways to declare array
========================
1. Using new keyword
2. Using literal

Syntax
=============
datatype arrayvariable_name[]=new datatype[size];

Iterate array
=============
1.Simple for loop
2.for each loop
